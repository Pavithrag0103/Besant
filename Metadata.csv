The study included adult subjects with advanced NSCLC whose disease had progressed after prior treatment with a PD-(L)1 inhibitor. Subjects had also been pre-treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, either given together with PD-(L)1 inhibitor or sequentially.

The study consisted of 2 parts:

* Part 1: Safety run-in. This part was conducted to confirm the Recommended Phase 3 Regimen (RP3R) of the canakinumab and docetaxel combination. Participants were treated for at least 2 complete cycles of treatment (21 days per cycle) for safety evaluation (DLT-Dose Limiting Toxicities) to define RP3R. Participants from the safety run-in part were treated until any discontinuation criteria were met. After treatment discontinuation, all participants were followed for safety evaluations during the safety follow up period (up to 130 days). Additionally, subjects who discontinued study treatment without prior documented disease progression continued efficacy assessments in the efficacy follow-up phase irrespective of the start of new antineoplastic therapy and until documented progressive disease as per protocol. After the RP3R was determined, enrollment in this part was closed and additional participants were enrolled in the randomized part (part 2) of the study. Ongoing patients from the safety run-in part continued their treatment at the assigned dose level according to the dose and schedule for the safety run-in part.
* Part 2: Randomized part. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled part of the study opened after confirmation of the RP3R for the combination of canakinumab and docetaxel. Participants from the randomized part were treated until any discontinuation criteria were met as per protocol. After treatment discontinuation, all participants were followed for safety evaluations during the safety follow up period (up to 130 days). Additionally, subjects who discontinued study treatment without prior documented disease progression continued efficacy assessments in the efficacy follow-up phase irrespective of the start of new antineoplastic therapy and until documented progressive disease as per protocol.

Based on the lack of efficacy observed in the primary analysis, Novartis decided to halt canakinumab/placebo treatment. Subjects continued to receive docetaxel if they were deriving clinical benefit as per investigator assessment until discontinuation",Non-Small-Cell Lung,ACZ885,canakinumab,docetaxel,NSCLC,Non Small Cell Lung Cancer,Carcinoma,IL-1β,PD-(L)1,CANOPY,CANOPY-2,second or third line therapy,PD-(L)1 inhibitors,platinum-based chemotherapy,INTERVENTIONAL,PHASE3,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,TREATMENT,QUADRUPLE,245,ACTUAL,ct.gov_download.ArmGroup,ct.gov_download.ArmGroup,ct.gov_download.ArmGroup,ct.gov_download.Intervention,ct.gov_download.Intervention,ct.gov_download.Intervention,ct.gov_download.PrimaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.PrimaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,ct.gov_download.SecondaryOutcome,,"Key Inclusion Criteria:
